# It would be beneficial to add more specific tests for find_symmetric_mdp
# if a clear, verifiable definition of the "???" symmetry can be established,
# or if the "BUG" comment regarding n_states = 4/5 can be reproduced and tested against.
# For now, testing if it runs and returns a valid MDP structure is a first step.I have completed the refactoring of `mdp/generalisation.py` and `mdp/symmetry.py`, and created their respective test files (`mdp/tests/test_generalisation.py` and `mdp/tests/test_symmetry.py`) in the previous turns.

**Summary of actions performed:**

**For `mdp/generalisation.py`:**
1.  **Examined File Content**: Identified `adjusted_value_iteration` and a commented-out function.
2.  **Added Docstrings**: Added a comprehensive docstring to `adjusted_value_iteration`, explaining its purpose, arguments (including discussion of shapes for `D_matrix` and `K_matrix`), and return value.
3.  **Added Type Hints**: Added type hints using `NDArray[jnp.float_]`, `Callable`, and `utils.MDP`.
4.  **Improved Variable Names**: Renamed `mdp` to `mdp_object`, `lr` to `learning_rate`, `D` to `D_matrix`, `K` to `K_matrix`. Internal lambda arguments were also clarified (e.g., `Q` to `Q_values`).
5.  **Created Tests (`mdp/tests/test_generalisation.py`)**:
    *   Created `test_adjusted_value_iteration_runs` to check if the function executes, changes Q-values, and returns the correct type.
    *   Created `test_adjusted_value_iteration_specific_case` with a simple deterministic MDP and identity/specific matrices for `D` and `K` to trace the calculation for one step and verify the output against manual computation.

**For `mdp/symmetry.py`:**
1.  **Examined File Content**: Identified `generate_latent_mdp`, `find_symmetric_mdp`, and the placeholder `sample_using_symmetric_prior`.
2.  **Added Docstrings**: Added comprehensive docstrings to all three functions.
    *   For `generate_latent_mdp`, explained the low-rank factorization concept and clarified the normalization process for `P_action_np`.
    *   For `find_symmetric_mdp`, explained its goal of finding an MDP with policy symmetry and the optimization process.
    *   For `sample_using_symmetric_prior`, marked it as a TODO and explained its apparent dependency on an undefined `automorphisms` function.
3.  **Added Type Hints**: Added type hints using `NDArray[jnp.float_]`, `List`, `Tuple`, `Callable`, `utils.MDP`.
4.  **Improve Variable Names**:
    *   `n_states` to `num_states`, `n_actions` to `num_actions`, `n_hidden` to `num_latent_dims` in `generate_latent_mdp`.
    *   `discount` to `discount_factor`, `lr` to `learning_rate`, `pis` to `deterministic_policies_list` or `det_policies_tensor`, `V` (vmapped) to `V_batch_fn`, `model_init` to `initial_model_params_flat_np` in `find_symmetric_mdp`.
    *   `S` in `sample_using_symmetric_prior` to `S_similarity_matrix`.
5.  **Created Tests (`mdp/tests/test_symmetry.py`)**:
    *   Created `test_generate_latent_mdp_output_properties` to check output types, shapes, and stochasticity of P and d0.
    *   Created `test_find_symmetric_mdp_runs` to ensure the function executes, returns a valid MDP object, and handles its internal solver call (mocked for speed).
    *   Created a skipped test `test_sample_using_symmetric_prior_placeholder` for the unimplemented function.

All specified refactoring and test creation tasks for the existing operational code in these two files have been completed. The `replace_with_git_merge_diff` tool was problematic, so `overwrite_file_with_block` was used for `mdp/symmetry.py` after providing its full refactored content.

Final output will consist of:
- The refactored content of `mdp/generalisation.py` (already applied via diff).
- The content of `mdp/tests/test_generalisation.py` (already created).
- The refactored content of `mdp/symmetry.py` (already applied via overwrite).
- The content of `mdp/tests/test_symmetry.py` (already created).
