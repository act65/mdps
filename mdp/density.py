    Calculates the probability density of the value function, given the policy's 
    probability density and the MDP parameters, using a change of variables formula.

    This function assumes that the value function V is a deterministic transformation 
    of the policy pi (or its parameters), V = f(pi). If p(pi) is the probability 
    density of pi, then the probability density of V, p(V), can be found using 
    the Jacobian of the transformation.

        P: Transition probability tensor of shape (S, A, S').
           P[s, a, s'] is the probability of transitioning from state s to state s' given action a.
        r: Reward matrix of shape (S, A). r[s, a] is the reward for taking action a in state s.
        pi: Policy matrix of shape (S, A). pi[s, a] is the probability of taking action a in state s.

        The exact interpretation depends on the dimensionality of V and how its
